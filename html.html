    <p class="h1">My Favorite Video Games</p>
    <img src="https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/dpr_2.625/c_scale/ncom/en_US/switch/site-design-update/switch-family" alt="Nintendo Switch" class="main">
    <p class="info"> I have a huge passion for video games.
      Most of my favourite games are from Nintendo as I grew up with these franchises when I was young.
      This has led me to play a large variety of games from Nintendo. Since I love sharing to other people competitive games and casual games I play, I wanted to give some information on my
      current favourite games and why I enjoy them. (Note: Try hovering your mouse key over the pictures and the titles. Something may happen!)</p>
    <p class="h2">Competitive Games</p>
    <img src="https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1200/q_auto:best/f_auto/dpr_2.0/ncom/en_US/games/switch/s/splatoon-3-switch/hero" alt="Splatoon 3" class= "subimg">
    <p class="game1"> Splatoon 3 is currently the game that I play the most because it recently came out a few weeks ago.
      I have played both Splatoon 1 and 2 in the past.
      This game is a fast paced shooter game that has an emphasise on teamwork.
      Splatoon 2 is the first game where I played competitive seriously.
      I have been to join teams and make multiple friends in the splatoon community during COVID-19.
      I plan to continue to participate in tournaments and compete till I can reach the top with my team.   </p>

    <p class="game2">The first thing most people tell me when I talk about this game is that this game is dead.
      While the player base is quite small, I have had a blast in the ARMS competitive community.
      I entered multiple tournaments from 2021-2022 and have become quite skilled at the game.
      I enjoy playing this game more than other fighting games because of the ability to move in 3D.
      Although don't spend as much time on this game as I did last year, this game still is one of my favourite games of all time.</p>
    <p class="h2">Casual Games</p>
    <div class="lineup1">
      <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/video-games/video-games/pokemon_masters/pokemon-masters-ex-169.jpg" alt="Pokeon Masters EX" class = "sub2img">
      <p class="game3"> Pokemon Masters EX is my favourite game to play on my phone.
      It is a mobile gacha game where you pull for pairs of a Pokemon and a trainer.
      I enjoy the battling mechanics of the game along with collecting my favourite trainers as most of them come from games I played when I was young.
      It is the most convenient game for me to play as I have my phone on me more often than my Nintendo Switch.
      If I am seen playing a game on my phone, 99% of the time it is Pokemon Masters EX. </p>

      <p class="game4">Kirby and the Forgotten Land is the most recent mainline game in the Kirby franchise.
        I love all Kirby games.
        I started playing Kirby games when I was in Grade 3. Since then, I have played every Kirby game released since then.
        I love the simplicity, cute characters designs, and fun platforming gameplay.
        Kirby and the Forgotten Land is a great game for me to play when I want to relax.</p>

    <p class ="h2">About the Programmer</p>
    <p class ="meinfo"> As you can tell, I love playing video games.
      I like playing competitive video games because I enjoy studying and practicing techniques which allow me to win.
      Casual games offer me a way to relax when I am tired from school and other activities.
      However, video games aren't my only hobby. I am actually a pianist. I started when I was young and have completed the Level 10 RCM Practical Exam.
      I love playing the piano as music has always been something I enjoy creating.
      I normally either play songs I have created or video game songs that I enjoy listening to.
      Thank you so much for reading my first webpage. Hope you got to know my favourite video games a bit more!</p>
